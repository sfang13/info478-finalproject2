        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            A total of 275 million people worldwide currently have an anxiety disorder, and nearly one third of adults and adolescents in
            the United States experience an anxiety disorder at some time in their lives.
            Anxiety disorders can develop at any time, and can be triggered by various factors such as genetics,
            environmental stressors, and traumatic experiences. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a host of stressors that can worsen anxiety symptoms.
            Social distancing and quarantine measures have lead to social isolation,
            and the danger of contracting the virus or passing it on to others has caused persistent worrying.
            Furthermore, the pandemic has disrupted daily routines and created economic and financial uncertainties,
            causing instability and generating feelings of apprehension.
            COVID-19 has ultimately led to a global rise in anxiety incidence, or the porportion of persons developing an anxiety disorder around the world.
            It is more important than ever to study
            the risk factors tied to anxiety incidence and how various subpopulations are impacted differently by these factors to better address their needs.
            This data product aims to share the analyses performed in this study with the general public,
            so no prior knowledge about anxiety indicator incidence is required to interpret the results presented.

          <p>This exploratory analysis of available datasets on anxiety incidence and pandemic impacts informed the creation of novel and unique data questions to investigate.
            First, it revealed that anxiety indicator incidence spiked for all age groups near the end of 2020.
            Similarly, new deaths seemed to reach its peak at the start of 2021.
            This inspired an investigation into whether new deaths or total deaths and indicators of anxiety were correlated.
          </p>
          <p>The exploratory analysis also demonstrated that females tend to have higher DALY values from anxiety disorders than males from 1990-2019, prior to the pandemic.
            The distribution of values for females is also greater. However, there are more high outliers for males.
            This suggested that sex is likely a factor influencing the indicators of anxiety during the pandemic and should be further examined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the exploratory analysis proposed that there are significant disparities in how anxiety disorders affect different subpopulations
            during and prior to the pandemic, but it does not clearly explore how socioeconomic class or working conditions may play a role. However, prior research
            illustrates how working from home may worsen feelings of isolation while essential workers experienced greater fear from increased risk of exposure.
            Therefore, this study must also explore how education level as a proxy for workplace quality may be correlated with anxiety indicator incidence.

        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
        <section>
          <article>
            <p><a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/Weekly-United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-/pwn4-m3yp">Weekly United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State</a></p>
            <p>This dataset was chosen because it documents indicators of anxiety during the pandemic while other sources only provided anxiety incidences prior to 2019,
              which is important to this research project because it intends to
              investigate the coorelation between pandemic-related risk factors and
              anxiety indicator incidence in various subpopulations.
            </p>
            <p>The significant features of the dataset therefore included "Indicators," which was set as "Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder"
              to limit project scope to anxiety indicators. The variable "Group" was used to categorize the data by age, sex, or education level.
              Additionally, "Time Period Start Date" was used when investigating change in anxiety indicators throughout the pandemic because
              it indicated the first day of each week indicators were recorded.
              Lastly, "Value" contained the reported frequency of symptoms.</p>

            <p><a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Anxiety-or-Depression-Based-on-Repor/8pt5-q6wp">Indicators of Anxiety or Depression Based on Reported Frequency of Symptoms During Last 7 Days</a></p>
            <p>This dataset was chosen because the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths likely contributed to the growth in indicators of anxiety during the pandemic.
              Furthermore, it covers a similar date range to the anxiety indicator incidence data, meaning visualizations from both datasets can be easily compared.
            </p>
            <p>The significant features of this dataset were "New Deaths" and "Start Date," though the exploratory analysis also examined "Total Deaths."
              Specifically, the number of new deaths recorded in "New Deaths" across time periods recorded in "Start Date" could be compared to indicators of anxiety
              throughout the pandemic.

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>Various plots were created in RStudio for the exploratory analysis and Tableau for the final analysis.
          These included a scatter plot, multiple box and whisker plots, and line charts.
          The box and whisker plots were created in the exploratory analysis because they are ideal for representing distribution of data.
          Line charts were created when measuring almost any variable over time, as they are best for representing data measured in a continous progression.
          Lastly, a scatter plot was created to compare new and total deaths because both variables were numeric and this plot is great for examining correlation between variables.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <h3>Are surpluses in anxiety incidence across all age groups during the pandemic correlated with increases in new or total deaths?</h3>
        <section id="special">

          <section>
            <p>
              To answer the first question, two line charts were created side by side to match the dates from both the
              anxiety indicator incidences and covid deaths datasets and reveal how the number of anxiety indicators
              over time correlated with new COVID deaths. One significant trend is that the surplus in anxiety indicator incidences
              correlated with the increase in new deaths at the end of 2020, the first year of covid. Furthermore, while both indicators of anxiety
              and new deaths dropped in the following months, they rose again by September 2021. However, anxiety indicator incidences remained high
              for the rest of the pandemic while new deaths eventually slowed again. Overall, this suggests that anxiety incidence across all age groups
              during the pandemic correlated with increases in new deaths. However, there is missing anxiety indicator data which cannot be factored into this conclusion.

        <h3>Are diverging distributions of DALYs from anxiety disorders male and female indicative of different impacts on either subpopulation by COVID-19?</h3>
        <section>
          <img src="img/sex_time.png" alt="Moon landing">
          <section>
            <p>
              To answer the second question, a line chart was created to investigate whether the diverging distributions of DALYs
              from anxiety disorders for males and females seen in the exploratory analysis is indicative of COVID-19 impacting each subpopulation differently.
              The visualization demonstrates that anxiety indicator incidence for both male and females was impacted by the pandemic.
              The incidence value was highest at over 120 for females around November 2020 and 95 for males around January 2021.
              These months roughly coincide with when the number of new COVID-19 deaths was highest.
              The incidence value was lowest in June 2021 for both females and males. Overall,
              anxiety indicator incidence was higher for females than males.
              The difference between male and female anxiety levels were consistent over time.
              Notably, the data has missing values, so neither line plot is continuous.
              While females had a wider distribution of DALYs from anxiety disorders than males, their average DALY was already higher prior to the pandemic.
              This likely explains why female anxiety indicator levels were consistently higher, and suggests that the pandemic impacted both subpopulations similarly.

        <h3>Given that education levels impact employment, are variations in education attainment and subsequently workplace correlated with higher anxiety incidence?</h3>
        <section>
          <img src="img/education_time.png" alt="Moon landing">
          <section>
            <p>
              The line chart created to answer the third question visualized how the highest levels of anxiety during the pandemic were
              amongst people who had no high school degree and the lowest were amongst those who had a Bachelor’s degree or higher. 
              Having an associates degree placed second highest and a high school degree placed third highest.
              Around 1050 was the highest for people without high school diplomas while 650 was the highest for those with bachelor’s
              degrees or higher, which is almost half of the initial value. This may be explained by people without high school
              diplomas being more likely to work essential jobs that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 while those with bachelor’s
              degrees have office jobs that can be performed from home. However, people with an associate’s
              degree experience higher levels of anxiety than those with a high school diploma.
              Furthermore, in contrast to previous findings, anxiety indicator incidence was highest for
              all subpopulations at the start of 2020, but low values later on could be due to data collection issues. Overall, better educational
              attainment and subsequently workplace correlated with lower anxiety incidence.
